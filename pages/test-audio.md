## I Know a Man  
<em>by Robert Creeley</em>

As I sd to my  
friend, because I am   
always talking,—John, I  

sd, which was not his  
name, the darkness sur-  
rounds us, what  

can we do against  
it, or else, shall we &  
why not, buy a goddamn big car,  

drive, he sd, for  
christ’s sake, look  
out where yr going.
